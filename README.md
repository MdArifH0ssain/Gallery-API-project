# Gallery-API-project
In this project I create a simple Android app that displays a list of photos(which came from API) as a 
gallery. Users can tap the photo to see a full-screen view of it with the possibility to zoom in and out.

# Feature

Searching different kinds of photos.<br/>
Allow shareing photo.<br/>
Allow saving photos in JPEG format to the local gallery.<br/>
Beautiful design pattern.<br/>
Allow Zoom in and out.<br/>
